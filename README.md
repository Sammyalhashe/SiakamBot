# Pascal Siakam Bot
* As an avid user of r/torontoraptors and r/nba, Pascal Siakam is a player I have noticed to have his name mispelled quite often.
* Variations of Siakim, Sakam, Sakiam have all been used. 
* He is one of my favourite players on my home team of the Toronto Raptors and I decided to be that pesky person who would create a bot that would correct people on their mispelling of his name.
* This script uses the `praw` library to parse Reddit
* `crontab` is used to execute the bot every 15 minutes on my mac.
